    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as climate change is increasing global temperatures, there are increasing reports that more hot days might lead to more violent crime. On January 19, 2017, the EPA estimated that the Pacific Northwest will see a 3-10 degree (Fahrenheit) increase in average temperatures by the end of the century [5]. If temperature is connected to crime, then an associated uptick in temperature suggests we should expected increased violent crime in Seattle. If true, this is something citizens and governmental agencies with law enforcement budgets should start planning for right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background, related work and research questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive relationship between crime and ambient temperature has been studied in Finland as reported in an article in the journal Nature [3]. It has also been studied in Chicago by publications like the Chicago Tribune [1, 2] and at least two independent data scientists [12,13]. All of these sources have shown that increases in violent crimes can been tied to warmer days and suggest a contemporaneous and positive link between temperature and violent crime. The Nature study went as far as to suggest causation by showing not only a relationship between crime and temperature, but also suggesting that certain biomarkers can correlated with both crime and temperature. Additionally, there is evidence that this view has taken hold in Seattle. A Fox news report included a statement from the Seattle Police Chief suggesting more crime as days get warmer [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I seek to better understand whether a positive relationship between temperature and crime in Seattle can be observed by looking at data from the past 5 years. I will attempt to establish a contemporaneous link by examining daily and hourly temperatures and the number of violent crimes occurring in Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the positive relationship between ambient temperature and violent crime observed in both Finland and Seattle, I hypothesized a positive, statically significant relationship between Seattle&#39;s temperature and violent crime, even when controlling for daylight hours, weekday, month of year and several other variables such as precipitation and wind. In addition to performing statistical analysis, I prepare some visualizations like those shown in the Chicago Tribune article [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "For weather information, I use METARs weather data collected from the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) for King County Airport (BFI). This data was provided by Iowa State University under an MIT license [7]. Since this is data intended for pilots, it is detailed. It is recorded hourly and includes temperature, sky coverage and precipitation details. For the daily dataset, I aggregate hourly datapoints in order to determine minimum and maximum daily temperature, daily precipitation levels and average windspeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data about crime, I use the Seattle Police Department Report Incident [8] and Offense Data [9], which is available under a Creative Commons License. This data includes a coded offense or incident type at the incident level of grain as well as start and end date and times for events. I pulled data for both police incidents and offenses and weather from 2012 through 2017, although I ended up analyzing only data between December 2012 and November 2017, due to some gaps in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sunrise and sunset times (used to determine daylight or nighttime hours), I refer to sunset and sunrise tables available from the US Naval Observatory [10]. According to their privacy notice, all information on their site is &quot;considered public information and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified.&quot;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting the data, I perform some exploratory analysis on each dataset. This includes getting descriptive statistics and using various techniques to identify any missing or anomalous elements. I include outliers (such as extreme temperatures or extreme counts of crime) in my analysis steps, but I remove any obviously erroneous elements that would lead to misleading results. Once scrubbed, I join the police, weather, max/min temperature and sunrise/sunset datasets on the time dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once joined, I label any burglary, assault, murder or extortion incident as a violent crime. These labels were chosen after examining the various options in Seattle PD data and because these types of crimes seem consistent with the Chicago Tribune [1] classification and several definitions of violent crime I found through Google searches. I label all other types of crime as non-violent crime; however I do not proceed to look at non-violent crime in subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "On my joined and labeled, I perform exploratory analysis, plotting temperature and crime across various dimensions such as weekday, time of day, month of the year. I generate several heatmaps to identify patterns. I also generate a pair-wise correlation for each of the continuous variables in my datasets. This exploratory analysis leads me to the use the following models in subsequent regression analysis steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "formula\\_day = Violent Crime Count  ~ Temp\\_F\\_Mean + Temp\\_F\\_High + C(Month) + C(Weekday) + Temp\\_F\\_High\\*Temp\\_F\\_Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "formula\\_hr = Violent Crime Count    ~ Temp\\_F + C(Month) + C(Weekday) + C(Weekday\\_Hour) + C(Daylight)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these models, I perform both negative binomial and linear regression analyses at both the hourly and daily levels of grain. In examining my results, I see that neither the negative binomial, poisson or linear model fit the data extremely well, however Negatively binomial regression seems to fit the best. I primarily draw on the negatively binomial regression analysis to infer a relationship between crime and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout data collection, cleaning and analysis steps, I attempt to follow a &quot;human-centered&quot; approach. For example, the police data does not include any identifying details about who might have been involved with the criminal incident. The data sources were all collected and processed in ways consistent with their license. Additionally, each step in the data gathering, processing and analysis steps are thoroughly documented in a Jupyter notebook, so the end-to-end study could be easily repeated or replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to my hypothesis and the results of other work, my analysis shows a very faint but statistically significant negative relationship between crime and temperature. In other words, controlling for month, weekday and (in the hourly dataset, weekday and hour and daylight vs. night), I find a decrease in temperature is associated with a very slight uptick in violent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistent with my observation in exploratory analysis, there is a very clear positive relationship between violent crime and weekend mornings (between midnight and 2am). There is also a clear positive relationship between crime and summer and fall months. Summer in particular is highly correlated with crime. Month of the year, time of day and day of the week have a much, much stronger positive relationship than the negative relationship between crime and temperature they are offsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several charts and the regression analysis results to support these findings can be seen in step 3 below and are described very clearly there.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion, implications and limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion of this work is that there does not appear to be a clear or strong contemporaneous link between temperature and violent crime, although more violent crime can certainly be linked to summer months, when the weather tends to be warmer. From this, I would conclude that we should proceed cautiously in making decisions about law enforcement budgets in anticipation of higher temperatures due to climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is not to say the link between violent crime and temperature is a complete red herring. There are several limitations of this study. This study only looked at data between 2012 and 2017. Expanding the dataset beyond these years and to other cities in the pacific northwest region in order to obtain a larger sample size might lead to different conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, although the study in Nature [3] did suggest violent crime and higher temperatures are linked contemporaneously, it also suggested an even higher correlation between the two when crime was considered against previous month&#39;s temperatures. Since my study did not examine any non-contemporaneous links between temperature and violent crime, or look at the data aggregated by month, we are unable to say we replicated this study end-to-end, completely invalidating its conclusions when applied to Seattle. To draw stronger conclusions, future work to replicate the Nature study more closely or to dig into the link between non-violent crime would be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the findings, I think these conclusions safely suggest we proceed carefully when linking temperature and crime to decision-making. Additionally, even if future work were to find a stronger correlation between the two, a causal link has not been well established so it may be unwise to base many governmental or personal planning decisions off of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to numerous articles and research publications showing a positive link between violent crime and temperature in Chicago and Finland, I hypothesized a similar link might existing in Seattle. After pulling weather and police incident data, I was unable to establish a contemporaneous, positive correlation between crime and temperature in Seattle over the past 5 years. My findings suggest instead that crime is much more closely linked with month of the year (regardless of temperature), day of the week and time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are certainly limitations of this work that leave me unable to &quot;have the last word&quot; on this topic, I think this work does give us reason to be cautious when assuming or planning for an increase in crime related to climate change. It also suggests we should be careful not to believe everything we read, especially when publications beg us to make decisions based on potentially spurious correlations, without a well-established causal link between correlated events.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its conclusions, this study was performed with repeatability in mind and is an attempt to demonstrate Human Centered Data Science best practices. All the steps performed from data gathering through to analysis are described in detail in the Jupyter notebook below. This approach should inform the readers understanding of Human Centered Data Science by demonstrating open data science best practices. This includes: citing all data sources carefully, making my downloaded data available, making processing and analysis steps easily reproducible through a Jupyter notebook, making any visualization available on GitHub and publishing everything else, including a clear Readme on GitHub. These steps will ensure my study is highly reproducible, so that anyone can check for errors or problems in my approach or easily build on my work. This will also ensure it can be replicated, in that the approach can be easily applied to similar datasets in other locales. I also hope that this will turn the data gathering and processing steps into a helpful starting point, especially if other researchers with a stronger statistical skillset decide to use a different approach to the analysis.\n",
